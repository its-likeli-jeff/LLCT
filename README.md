## LLCT

# 1. Introduction
LLCT is a two-step self-contained gene-set analysis method which is developed to handle multiple longitudinal outcomes. Analysis of within-subject variation in the first step is followed by examining the between-subject variation utilizing Linear Combination Test (LCT) in the second step. This method is also applicable in analysis of time-course microarray data.
